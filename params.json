Note that Bevel will work best in Chrome and Safari, but I'll try to keep support for Firefox.\r\n\r\n[![Login Screen](https://github.com/Blender3D/Bevel/raw/master/images/screenshots/1.png)](Demo)\r\n\r\n## Installing the Webkit greeter\r\nYou will first need the `lightdm` and `lightdm-webkit-greeter` packages. Xephyr is used for testing LightDM themes while logged in, so I'd install that as well\r\n\r\n### Arch Linux\r\nBoth packages can be installed from the AUR:\r\n\r\n    packer -S lightdm lightdm-webkit-greeter xorg-server-xephyr\r\n\r\nWhen building `lightdm`, edit the `PKGBUILD` and change line 38 from `--with-greeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter` to `--with-greeter-session=lightdm-webkit-greeter`.\r\n\r\nYou'll also have to make the Webkit greeter the default greeter via a symlink:\r\n\r\n    # cd /usr/share/xgreeters/\r\n    # ln -s lightdm-webkit-greeter.desktop default.desktop\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu\r\nBoth packages *seem* to be in the default repositories:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install lightdm lightdm-webkit-greeter xserver-xephyr\r\n\r\n### Others\r\nI've only really used Arch and Ubuntu, but I can imagine the instructions for other distros will vary only slightly.\r\n\r\n## Installing Bevel\r\nYou first have to edit the LightDM configuration file, which resides in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit-greeter.conf`. Change line 13 from `webkit-theme=webkit` (this might be different for Ubuntu) to `webkit-theme=bevel`.\r\n\r\nNext, you have to clone the repo:\r\n\r\n    # cd /usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/\r\n    # git clone https://github.com/Blender3D/Bevel bevel\r\n\r\nFinally, try out LightDM in test mode:\r\n\r\n    $ lightdm --test-mode","tagline":"A minimal theme for the LightDM Webkit greeter","google":""}
